%%Explain ancient conflict (since man was created)
%Galadin = L/C; Elph = G/E; list 2 atrocities and 1 miracle; Churches focus on the "good" aspects, ignore the "bad".

In the country of Emperia, there are two religions. One worships \cGaladin{}, \cGalandin{\God} of Renewal. The other worships \cElph{}, \cElph{\God} of Virtue. The two churches, and the conflict between them, have existed since time immemorial. Most citizens subscribe to one or other church, with a silent minority subscribing to neither. 

\section{The Church of Galadin}

CHAOTIC: Create the seasons. Previously endless summer.
LAWFUL: Turned a village full of people into Centaurs.
OTHER: Hand down a set of ``10 commandments'' advocating for change and chaos (ie: Do not allow your life to stagnate. missing basic tenants like do not steal) Maybe 5.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do not allow your life to stagnate. Embrace change. (Embrace change to prevent stagnation in your life)
\item Challenge others in unexpected ways.
\item Question authority but bow to tradition.
\item Complexity and nuance enrich life.
\item Enforce order.
\end{enumerage}

\section{Acts of Elph}
GOOD: Recent divine right to rule. 3 generations, 1 good, 1 bad, current monarch
EVIL: super harsh punishment for someone(s) - Wiping a country off the map (sink the entire continent?) A mad king goes on a rampage, ignoring warnings from Elph who eventually sinks the whole continent, killing good and evil.
