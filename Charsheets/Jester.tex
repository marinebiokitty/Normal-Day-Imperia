\name{\cJester{}}

You made a... deal. A deal with the powers that be, quite literally. They call themselves Gods, and, compared to the sleepers in this world, they might as well be. 

Luckily, you're not one of them.

You are not quite sure what you are, but you do know that you've been hopping dimensions for a Very Long Time. 214 years ago, you hopped from <insert thing here> to this place - where the unique magics trapped you. 214 years ago, you were a hero. 150 years ago, you were an archmage. 50 years ago, you were a \monarch{}. And now, after a fit of whimsy, you are a Jester. 

It's taken you a little while to work out how to escape, but by this point, you know that the answer lies in the poor mortal saps around you. You need to harness the power of a court full of fully awakened individuals to catapult you out of this accursed dimension.
